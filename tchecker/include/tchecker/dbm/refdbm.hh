 \brief Functions on DBMs with reference clocks
 \note A DBM with reference clocks is a DBM where the first refcount variables
 are reference variables, and the other variables are clock (or offset)
 variables. Each clock variable has a corresponding reference variable. The
 correspondance is defined according to an instance r of
 tchecker::reference_clock_variables_t. It associates to each clock variable X
 its reference clock r(X). Each reference clock is mapped to itself.

 The value of system clock x is represented as the value of X-r(X), the
 difference between the corresponding clock variable X and its reference clock
 r(X). Reference DBMs generalise standard DBMs which have a single reference
 clock, usually denoted 0.

 Reference DBMs have been introduced as "offset DBMs" in "Partial Order
 Reduction for Timed Systems", J. Bengtsson, B. Jonsson, J. Lilis and Wang Yi,
 CONCUR, 1998.
