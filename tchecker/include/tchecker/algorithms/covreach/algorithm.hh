 \tparam GRAPH : type of graph, should derive from
 tchecker::graph::subsumption::graph_t, and nodes of type GRAPH::shared_node_t

   \brief Build a covering reachability graph of a transition system from its
   initial states
   \param ts : a transition system
   \param graph : a graph
   \param labels : accepting labels
   \param policy : waiting list policy
   \post graph is a covering reachability graph of ts built from its initial
   states, until a state that satisfies labels is reached if any, or until the
   entire state-space has been exhausted.
   A node is created for each maximal state in ts, and an edge is created for
   each transition in ts. Actual edges correspond to transitions in ts. A
   subsumption edge from node n1 to node n2 means that the actual successor of
   n1 in ts is subsumed by n2.
   The order in which the nodes of ts are visited depends on policy.
   \return Statistics on the run
   \note if labels is empty, the algorithm explores the entire state-space
