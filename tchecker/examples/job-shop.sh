# Generates a TChecker model of a job shop scheduling problem as described in:
# "Scheduling with Timed Automata", AbdeddaÃ¯m, Asarin and Maler, TCS, 2004
# and:
# "Lower and Upper Bounds in Zone Based Abstractions of Timed Automata",
# Behrmann, Bouyer, Larsen and Pelanek, STTT, 2006.
#
# In the last paper, the authors do not check that each tasks lasts exactly
# N t.u., but at least N t.u. As far as one is concerned with schedulability,
# this is equivalent (If more than N CPU t.u. are given to the task, then
# consider the extra t.u. as idle CPU t.u.). This allows to have no upper-bounds
# on clocks which entails a great reduction with ExtraLU+
#
# The scripts generates a model with #J jobs and #M machines. Each job consists
# in upto #M tasks. Each task uses one of the machine for a given duration.
# Both the machine and the duration are chosen randomly. The accepting state
# (labelled "green") is reachable iff there is a feasible schedule within
# MAKESPAN time units

# Checks command line arguments
